# Feature pitch

ðŸ’¡ Use a pitch template to present a high view of a good potential bet. Teammates working on this project will be able to refine it from there, in a product specs doc.

# Background

Why are we doing this? What's the problem to solve? Is it strategic, tactical? Are there specific customer insights that could be quoted or data to back this up. A big project, a small project? Paint a picture to the reader so they are able to get a good overview of what's happening.

# What should we do about it

Explore the solution to a goldilocks level. Explore the rabbit holes, provide some mockups. This is not a full spec, but should give enough information to start working.

# How do we announce this

What is the approach for launching this and talking about it to our customers. Provide not only the approach, but also some copy and benefit. Ping @laure on this.

# How will we measure success?
